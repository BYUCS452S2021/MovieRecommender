# MovieRecommender
Team members: Jackson Howe, Parker Murray

The purpose of this project is to help pairs of people (couples, friends, etc) decide on a new movie to watch that neither have seen and is interesting to both.
We'll create a webapp where individuals can join and link themselves to another user. Each user will be presented with a trailer and synopsis of a popular movie
from a public api. The user will rate how interested they are in that movie and whether they've seen it. At the same time, the app will show trailers to the linked
partner, particularly one's that the first found interesting. Once there's a collision, the movie will be added to a watchlist. Over time, a database will grow
with a watchlist and a list of movies that the user has already rejected.

A team of 2-3 people will be sufficient to complete this project, and we'll likely use a document DB when we convert from a relational database to a NoSQL DB.

### Business
The app will be free to use but could eventually be extended to use affiliate links to movie streaming services (like Prime Video) and advertising to generate
revenue.

### Operations
The founders will operate as chiefs of operations and can eventually hire others as needed.

### Legal
This business will be incorperated in Utah.

### Technical
I primarily have experience in React as a webapp frontend, PostgreSQL as a relational database, and Amazon DynamoDB as a NoSQL database, so I'd prefer to use that
stack when implementing the project, but I'm also open to other platforms if team members have other experience.

### Social
The app can be advertised initially through word-of-mouth, but could also be advertised on Instagram Ads once monetized.

## Building the App
See the README files in /ui and /server to set up the frontend and backend servers, respectively.
